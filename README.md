## Two-Factor Authentication for Wi-Fi Networks with NFC

  We’ve created an Android application to expedite the process for both the user and administrator. Using NFC (Near-Field Communication) technology, administrators can write their network credentials to an NFC tag for users to quickly read and connect to Wi-Fi networks. 
  
  For administrators wishing to add a layer of security without sacrificing usability, we’ve also added a two-factor authentication mechanism which will require a user’s physical presence and manually-input password. With this functionality, users must both read from the NFC tag with the application and manually type in a password to produce to correct Wi-Fi password and connect to the desired network.

## Motivation

  A major source of friction for users with Internet-enabled devices is the process of connecting to a trusted and secured Wi-Fi network. For users, this typically involves asking the administrator for a long string of letters and characters that require manual input into the device. Currently, administrators must sacrifice the added security of long, complicated passwords for those that are easily shareable in situations of visiting guests or new users. We've aimed to solve both of these issues.

## Status

Development is currently on hiatus for research into the possible security implications of the application.
